## Start with the user

The sentence should start with the words "As a user, I can"

> As a user, I can

If you have different kinds of users, be more specific:

> As an admin user, I can...

> As a mobile firefox user, I can...

## State what the user wants

Continue the sentence by saying what the user wants:

> As a user, I can view a product's details

## Say why they want to do this

It's important to show that the feature adds value to the user's experience or to the overall value of the product.

> As a user, I can view a product's details so that I know if its specifications and price fit my needs and budget.
