# Wizard form:

- create a form editing 3 attributes:
  - name
  - occupation
  - house
- when the form is submitted, save that to an array
  - confirm the new wizard is in the array by:
    - console.log()
    - maybe list them out?
    - or just use the inspector
- when do we need useEffect?
  - if we want to edit :)
